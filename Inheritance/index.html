  <h1>Inheritance</h1>
  <h4>Objects and Functions</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Every JS object has a prototype property which makes inheritance possible in JS</li>
    <li>The prototype property of an object is where we put method and properties that we want other objects to
      inherit</li>
    <li>The constuctor's prototype property is not the prototype property of the constructor itself, it's the
      prototype of all instances that are created through it</li>
    <li>When a certain method or property is called, the search starts in the object itslef and if cannot be found
      the search moves on to object prototype prototype. This continues until the method is found in the prototype
      chain</li>
  </ul>
