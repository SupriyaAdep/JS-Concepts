GAME RULES:

- The game has 2 players, playing in rounds
- In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as he wishes. 
  Each result get added to his ROUND score
- BUT, if the player rolls a 1, all his ROUND score gets lost. 
  After that, it's the next player's turn
- The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his ROUND score gets added 
  to his GLBAL score. After that, it's the next player's turn
- The first player to reach 100 points on GLOBAL score wins the game
*/
/*
NEXT STEPS

Change the game to follow these rules
 - A player looses his ENTIRE score when he rolls two 6 in a row. After that it is the
 next player's turn. (Hint: Always store the prevoius dice roll in a separate variable)
 - Add a input field to the HTML, where the players can set the winning goal
 - Add one more dice, so that there are two dices now. The player loses his current score when
 one of them is 1
